1
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:13,920
Wise men say

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,170
Only fools rush in

3
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:35,920
But I can't help falling in love with you

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,070
Shall I stay?

5
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:49,820
Would it be a sin

6
00:00:49,820 --> 00:01:04,570
If I can't help falling in love with you?

7
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,360
Like a river flows

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,760
Surely to the sea

9
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,250
Darling, so it goes

10
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:22,510
Some things are meant to be

11
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:28,750
Take my hand

12
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:36,510
Take my whole life too

13
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:51,010
For I can't help falling in love with you

14
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,500
Like a river flows

15
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,000
Darling, so it goes

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,750
Some things are meant to be

17
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:08,640
Take my hand

18
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,890
Take my whole life too

19
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:22,040
For I can't help falling in love with you

20
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:36,940
For I can't help falling in love with you
